# Trevor Rapp improvement log:

### TL;DR

Since we last talked I have completed 5 React projects, 2 Test Driven Development Projects, an API project, and built a roadmap for future success.

See them at: 

- [Gadabout The World](https://gadabouttheworld.com)

- [Air BNB Experiences Clone](https://trrapp12.github.io/REACT-AirBNB-Clone/)
- [React Jokes Web Page](https://trrapp12.github.io/React-Jokes/)
- [Basic React App](https://trrapp12.github.io/my-app/) 
- [React Facts](https://trrapp12.github.io/react-facts/)
- [jest-test-driven-fizz-buzz](https://github.com/trrapp12/jest-test-driven-fizz-buzz)

- [Jokes API](https://rapp-dad-jokes-api.herokuapp.com/jokes)


### Purpose:

The last interview experience was super-exciting.  I loved the idea of combining my passion for the Chinese culture and web development in such a meaningful project as designing the UX/UI for Jiapu.  

At the end of the interview there were some areas that we determined I needed to strengthen inorder to be ready to step into the role in a productive manner. 

Though it was disappointing at first, I strongly believe in the words of Marcus Aurelius.

> The impediment to inaction advances action, what stands in the way becomes the way -- Marcus Aurelius. 

In other words, instead of leaving the interview and returning to the status quo, I determined I would use this opportunity to accelerate my growth. 

...and I'm sure once you see both the volume and technicality of the work that I have completed in the short time since our interview you will see that I have advanced in leaps-and-bounds. 

### What we decided needed work

* React, React, React
* test driven development
* deeper knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals

### What else I did just for fun

---

  * REACT hooks
  * Advanced API 
  * setting and updating State
  * REACT components
  * REACT lifecycle methods
  * Higher order Components
  * REACT 18 updates 
  * Advanced JavaScript algorithms
  * Advanced CSS projects solidifying mobile first and responsive design

<br>
<br>

### Conclusion: 

---

*One of the harder things to determine in an interview are skills like determination, dedication, and consistency.  My last few months are a great example of how much determination I have and how quickly dedication and consistency can produce solid results.*
